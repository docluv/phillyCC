You know that indexes often can help with query performance, but how do you even start going about it.</p>\n<p>Join Sebastian Meine, Ph.D. for this truly interactive session and discover how indexes in SQL Server work. After attending, you�ll be able to answer common index questions, like:</p>\n<p>&#8211; Which columns should I add to my index?<br />\n&#8211; How many indexes should I add to my new table?<br />\n&#8211; Does the column order in my index have to match that in my query?<br />\n&#8211; Does it hurt to have too many indexes?<br />\n&#8211; When should I consolidate Indexes?<br />\n&#8211; Are there queries that get slower after I create an index?</p>\n<p>But even more important, you�ll be able to explain how indexes are organized in SQL Server and what mechanism is responsible for the amazing performance gains you can achieve with them.</p>\n<p>Don�t miss this unique session.
