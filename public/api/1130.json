This presentation focuses on innovative problem solving techniques � the tools and techniques to use when your normal process just doesn�t seem to get you to a solution. Much of the information in this talk is based on Robert Pirsig�s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, which, although it is focusing on Motorcycles, applies to all kinds of problem spaces (and Pirsig was a tech writer for IBM). These techniques have served me well over the years. The difference in art versus science approaches is actually supported by the way the brain works. The talk will cover such areas as:<br />\n* Traditional Problem Solving Methods, where they fall down<br />\n* Eastern techniques, advantages, disadvantages<br />\n* General Tips and how they apply in specific examples<br />\n* Brain versus Mind</p>\n","room":"Merion","speaker":"David Horvath","badge":""},{"id":15890,"date":"2018-03-24T11:30:23","time":"11:30","slug":"getting-pushy-with-signalr-and-reactive-extensions-2","title":"Getting pushy with SignalR and Reactive Extensions","body":"<p>As our systems increasingly demand more real-time updates, we need better ways of working with these live streams of information. Traditional pull models fail to provide the real-time responsiveness and scale needs that modern systems expect. Moving to a push model allows us to scale easier and react to new data as it becomes available. SignalR facilitates push notifications over HTTP to a variety of clients. The Reactive Extensions were designed to allow for asynchronous LINQ over push based collections. In this talk, you�ll see how the synergy of these two technologies merge to make otherwise difficult tasks, a push over.</p>\n","room":"MPR II","speaker":"Jim Wooley","badge":"MVP"},{"id":15900,"date":"2018-03-24T11:30:45","time":"11:30","slug":"go-serverless-with-azure-functions-logic-apps-and-eventgrid","title":"Go Serverless with Azure Functions, Logic Apps and EventGrid","body":"<p>Azure�s serverless story makes it dead simple to decompose your clunky monolithic apps into performant DevOps-friendly microservices.
