Many organizations see DevOps as build automation, server administration or release management. In other people&#8217;s view, it is IT Operations. All of this is true, however, DevOps is much more. In this talk, we will discuss the full meaning of DevOps &#8211; People, Process and Tooling. Introducing DevOps to an organization addresses cultural changes, process improvement along with tooling. We will also show how Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Azure are designed with DevOps in mind. Come and share your experiences and learn from one another.</p>\n","room":"Paoli","speaker":"Brian Minisi","badge":"MVP"}
