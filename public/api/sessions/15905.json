We&#8217;ll start off with an introduction to what graphs are, how we can work with them, and what &#8216;graph theory&#8217; is. From there, we&#8217;ll delve into usage within programming languages of several paradigms, including JavaScript, F#, and C#. Finally, we&#8217;ll look at graphs as an effective way to store real business data and the benefits that this path lends itself to.</p>\n","room":"Strafford","speaker":"Stachu Korick","badge":""}
