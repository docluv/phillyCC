They combine maximum customer reach with platform integrations previous reserved to native apps. </p>\n<p>Progressive web apps have technical requirements of HTTPS, a valid web manifest and a registered service worker. As usual things are not as simple as they seem. </p>\n<p>This session demonstrates how you can create a simple progressive web app in under an hour. You will learn how to quickly create a minimum progressive web app and then apply some intermediate techniques to improve the application&#8217;s performance and user experience. </p>\n<p>The goal is to learn how you can adjust traditional web site architecture to be a proper PWA that you can take back and upgrade new and existing web sites to be a good progressive web app.</p>\n","room":"MPR I","speaker":"Chris Love","badge":"MVP"}
