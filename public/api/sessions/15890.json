Traditional pull models fail to provide the real-time responsiveness and scale needs that modern systems expect. Moving to a push model allows us to scale easier and react to new data as it becomes available. SignalR facilitates push notifications over HTTP to a variety of clients. The Reactive Extensions were designed to allow for asynchronous LINQ over push based collections. In this talk, youï¿½ll see how the synergy of these two technologies merge to make otherwise difficult tasks, a push over.</p>\n","room":"MPR II","speaker":"Jim Wooley","badge":"MVP"}
