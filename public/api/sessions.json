It is Microsoft’s premier platform for building, deploying and managing robust, scalable microservice systems in the Cloud or on-prem. Central to Azure Service Fabric’s development experience is its powerful microservice-oriented programming models. These models fill the gap left by orchestration-only technologies such as Kubernetes, enabling teams to build low latency, high scale microservices using familiar techniques that are more robust, consistent, repeatable and extensible.\r\n\r\nIn this technically immersive hands-on workshop, Service Fabric expert Michael ‘Monty’ Montgomery will walk you through building your own Service Fabric reference architecture. You will first learn the basics of the various stateless Reliable Service programming models. You will then create a stateless API, a stateless Remoting service and connect them together into a meaningful architecture. Along the way, you will learn the basic system structure of a Service Fabric ‘application’ and how that structure relates to defining, configuring, hosting, deploying and ultimately consuming the services associated with it. \r\n\r\nMonty will also reveal ServiceFabricEx, a powerful, publicly available framework he created that enhances the Service Fabric’s programming model to (re)introduce an extensible aspect-oriented techniques for injection, interception, policy enforcement and context flow.",

Users no longer accept a UI that's merely functional; it has to be intuitive, fast, and visually appealing.\r\n\r\nOur discussion will focus on the patterns and practices any developer can employ without specialized design or graphics knowledge. We'll cover how we've evolved a real-world, large application to deliver for a really difficult audience - impatient developers. You'll be able to apply these same techniques in your own apps to get better results from your user community.\r\n",

Though it's true that today's world runs on JavaScript, the language was created with form validation and basic DOM manipulation in mind so it leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to writing real-world applications with it. So much so that Douglas Crockford felt the need to write a book entitled, \"JavaScript the Good Parts\" and Anders Hejlsberg, the father of C#, decided to focus his decades of language development expertise into bringing JavaScript into the world of mature, respectable languages by creating TypeScript.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation I'll show just what TypeScript is, how it relates to the concepts you already know today, and why you would might consider writing all your web applications in TypeScript rather than plain old JavaScript from now on.",

While the GNU version of these tools will be the focus, the skills learned apply to many different platforms. Being available on so many platforms gives you lots of choices. Your choices include Microsoft’s Bash under Windows 10, Cygwin under many Microsoft Windows versions, MAC OSX, the Linux core of Android, commercial Linux — like Red Hat Enterprise, and commercial UNIX — like IBM’s AIX or Sun/Oracle’s Solaris.\r\n\r\nOf particular interest are ‘head’, ‘tail’, ‘wc’, ‘awk’, ‘dd conv’, and shells.\r\n\r\nA few of the differences between UNIX/Linux and Windows will also be discussed to ease your shifts in our heterogeneous environments.

How well would you do?  \r\n\r\nIn this highly-interactive presentation I'm turning the tables on the standard \"lecture and learn\" style and putting you in the hot seat.  Sure, the discussion will cover the concepts, patterns and practices of JavaScript experts, only I'll be asking the questions and everyone else will be giving the answers. \r\n\r\nThis format allows plenty of room for everyone to participate however they choose, regardless of skill level or experience.  In other words, feel free to join in the discussion, simply sit back, listen, and learn from the folks around you, or anywhere in between - your level of involvement is entirely up to you.\r\n\r\nHere's your opportunity to go on that really difficult technical interview, only in a much more forgiving environment where a wrong answer doesn't cost you the shot at your dream job.\r\n\r\nAre you game?",
