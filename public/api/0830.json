Maybe you&#8217;re unimpressed with the books that are out there on your favorite topic. Maybe writing a book is on your bucket list. This session will help your idea reach its potential as a published book. Technical publishing is an opaque process with a lot of moving parts, which can be confusing for outsiders to navigate. This session will guide you through the steps you should take to turn an idea into a proposal that a publisher will accept, and what to expect from the publishing experience.</p>\n<p>Creating a great technical book takes more than a good idea. It also requires a knowledge of the market, to determine whether there&#8217;s an audience willing to buy, or whether the space is too crowded to accept new entries. Publishers vary in their approach and target markets, so you need to determine which one will provide the best chance of success. Self-publishing is an option, but carries its own risks and benefits. Doing the setup work that you may not have thought about yet will help you create a proposal that will appeal to publishers, and will also make the writing process easier.</p>\n<p>Once you have a contract with a publisher, or have decided to self-publish, it&#8217;s more than just a matter of putting the words in order. Finding the right environment, setting a schedule, and communicating with your editor are all critical to success. This session will explain how the process works, highlight the parts you may not know, and give you advice on how not to get overwhelmed by your project.</p>\n",

Programmers of these products know how to partition computations over large distributed datasets in order to take full advantage of modern hardware and computing environments. These programming skills are not easy to master. This course will introduce technologies and tools available to developers at every level who are interested in achieving high-performance, reliable and maintainable code through functional-style parallelism and concurrency.</p>\n<p>We are facing a new era of geographically-distributed, highly-available systems with processor designs that are scaling out in core counts quicker than they are scaling up in core speeds. In keeping up with performance expectations as complexities and dataset grow, scaling out software architectures over these modern computing resources is one of the biggest challenges facing developers today. </p>\n<p>This course will introduce you to technologies and tools available to developers at every level who are interested in achieving exceptional performance in applications. You will gain an insight into the best practices necessary to build concurrent and scalable programs in .NET using the functional paradigm, which covers OnPrem and Cloud based applications.</p>\n<p>Notes and comments<br />\nThe following objectives will be satisfied during the duration of the course:</p>\n<p>1.\tFunctional Programming Techniques for Concurrency<br />\n2.\tBuilding high-performance concurrent systems<br />\n3.\tImplementing high-volume real-time event stream processing<br />\n4.\tImplementing concurrent patterns such as divide-and-conquer, fork/join, producer-consumer, Map-Reduce, pipeline and more<br />\n5.\tAsynchronous Functional Combinators<br />\n6.\tApplying Reactive Programming Everywhere with Agents and Actors<br />\n7.\tHow to develop applications that scale up &#038; out using the same programming model (Agents and/or Actors)</p>\n<p>Target Audience<br />\nAny developer who want to improve their skills and employ polyglot techniques to solve concurrent problems</p>\n<p>Prerequisite<br />\nThe preferred audience for this course is as follows:<br />\n&#8211; Developer with 2-3 years&#8217; experience and/or architect.<br />\n&#8211; Basic knowledge a programming language, recommended either C# or F#<br />\n&#8211; No experience in functional programming is necessary<br />\n&#8211; Developers who want to improve their skills and employ polyglot techniques to solve problems.</p>\n",
