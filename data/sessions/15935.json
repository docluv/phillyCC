You�ll learn how a CPU turns the code we feed it into actions, what�s the big difference between an ARM and an Intel processor, how CPU�s constantly optimize work for us, and where is it all going for the next few years.</p>\n<p>Finally, we&#8217;ll show how Meltdown and Spectre take advantage of CPU internals to expose data and why this class of security problems are going to be a challenge to the next generation of CPU&#8217;s.</p>\n","room":"Strafford","speaker":"Kendall Miller","badge":""}
