They use the best web architecture and APIs to provide the best user experiences. All browsers, including Chrome, Edge, FireFox, Safari, Opera and Samsung Internet have added or are in the process of adding progressive web application support. This makes PWAs a ubiquitous solution for engaging applications.<br />\nPWAs utilize new technologies like service worker caching, background sync and deep platform integrations like push notifications. But most developers have little to no experience writing service workers and architecting effective caching.</p>\n<p>In this workshop we will create a new application that implements the baseline progressive web application requirements.
