We will demo how to get started with Azure using Dev Essentials, a free offering from Microsoft for developers to get started with developing on Azure, and we&#8217;ll show several ways to get a SharePoint farm up and running using the SharePoint farm wizard in Azure. Once we have our SharePoint 2013 farm up and running, we will demo adding an Azure based virtual machine to our SharePoint 2013 farm, and then install SharePoint 2016 on it, to give us both a SharePoint 2013 and 2016 farm in the cloud!</p>\n","room":"Envision","speaker":"David Patrick","badge":""}
