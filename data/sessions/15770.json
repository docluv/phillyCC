A microservice architecture is a very different approach to building applications. In this hands-on lab we&#8217;ll build the data and services layers as well as server-less features for an ultra-modern business plan and marry them to pre-built web and mobile apps for an end-to-end example that demonstrates how apps are now being built. This is not the architecture youï¿½re accustomed to!</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need an Azure subscription, so sign up for a free trial on Thursday if you don&#8217;t already have one. We&#8217;re also going to use Visual Studio 2017 with at least the &#8220;ASP.NET and web development&#8221;, &#8220;Azure development&#8221;, &#8220;Data storage and processing&#8221; and &#8220;.NET Core cross-platform development&#8221; workloads installed. The &#8220;Mobile development with .NET&#8221; workload is optional. The free Community Edition is fine. If you are running Windows 10 Pro or above and want to use Docker containers for the lab, please install the latest Docker For Windows from https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/ as well.</p>\n","room":null,"speaker":"Mike Yeager","badge":""}
