We will be building an Android app together. The basic topics that will be covered include:</p>\n<p>&#8211; Xamarin.Forms Controls and XAML<br />\n&#8211; Authentication using both JWT and also Xamarin.Auth<br />\n&#8211; Navigation in Xamarin.Forms<br />\n&#8211; Local databases with SQLite</p>\n<p>To code along, please bring a laptop with Visual Studio installed (either Windows 10 or Mac OSX.) To test the application locally, it&#8217;s recommended to install Android Studio as well for the SDK tools and emulators. You can also use an Android phone connected via USB in developer mode. I will be providing a RESTful API we will use for our application.</p>\n<p>If time permits, these advanced topics can be covered:</p>\n<p>&#8211; XAML design using Live Player or Gorilla Player<br />\n&#8211; iOS development (with Unified API)<br />\n&#8211; Animations (using AirBnb&#8217;s Lottie library)<br />\n&#8211; Continuous integration using Jenkins<br />\n&#8211; Incorporating an Android widget into the app</p>\n","room":null,"speaker":"Mike Melusky","badge":""}
