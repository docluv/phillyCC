In this session we&#8217;ll introduce you to the capabilities of the compiler platform and demonstrate how we can extend it to more proactively catch common coding smells and patterns that would have otherwise caused runtime exceptions that can be caught during compilation instead. If you&#8217;ve relied on third party commercial coding tools like resharper in the past, you&#8217;ll see how you can build your own tooling extensions or leverage some of the many open source solutions.</p>\n","room":null,"speaker":"Jim Wooley","badge":"MVP"}
