A look at .NET Core on Linux and Visual Studio Code","body":"<p>.NET Core promises to remove the shackles from Windows and Visual Studio! How does this all work with .NET Core 2.0? What does the development process look like and can you really use a Linux desktop as your daily development driver?</p>\n<p>Most of us are going to let Visual Studio do the heavy lifting, and that&#8217;s fine, but in this session, we&#8217;ll put the IDE aside and work with .NET Core more directly. We&#8217;ll install the .NET Core SDK, create some apps with the dotnet CLI and get them running in Linux and on a few Azure services as well.</p>\n<p>This session is perfect for .NET veterans who are brand new to .NET Core and want to see what the brave new world looks and feels like. It&#8217;s okay if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with Linux, but are interested in having options available to you. And if you&#8217;re curious what the development experience is like in Visual Studio Code, this session is for you.</p>\n","room":"Berwyn","speaker":"Chris Gomez","badge":"MVP"}
